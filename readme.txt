Transform your WordPress site into a fully self-contained static website — fast, lightweight, and completely offline-ready.

== Description ==

**Static Cache Wrangler** is a *lazy-loading, low-resource static cache and export engine* that automatically creates self-contained HTML versions of your WordPress site.  

It's perfect for anyone who wants to **preserve, distribute, or accelerate WordPress content** — whether you're archiving a client site, deploying to a CDN, or creating a portable offline version that just works anywhere.

Unlike traditional static site plugins that require full re-builds or database schema changes, **Static Cache Wrangler is zero-impact** —  
* It does not add custom database tables or modify your schema.
* All plugin options, cron jobs, and transients are automatically cleaned up upon uninstall.
* Your WordPress database remains exactly as it was before installation.

**Perfect for:**
* Creating fully offline or portable copies of WordPress sites
* Rsyncing to read-only Nginx failover servers for high availability
* Publishing WordPress content to Amazon S3, Netlify, or static CDNs
* Geo-distributing cached static copies for fast global reads
* Archiving, demos, and secure client deliverables

---

### How It Works

1. Enable static site generation using the toggle in the sidebar.  
2. As users browse your site normally, each page visit creates a static HTML file.  
3. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts) are automatically downloaded and localized.  
4. Processing happens in the background and can be paused anytime.  
5. Download the complete static site as a ZIP file.  
6. Extract and open `index.html` in any browser — it works completely offline.

### Key Features

**What's New in 2.0.5:**

Version 2.0.5 introduces enhanced static HTML output with comprehensive WordPress meta tag removal. Your generated static files are now 3.1% smaller, generate 2.3% faster, and contain zero WordPress-specific metadata. This makes them truly portable, more secure (no version exposure), and perfect for offline use or deployment to any platform.

Two new developer hooks (`stcw_remove_wp_head_tags` and `stcw_process_static_html`) enable companion plugins and custom integrations, opening up possibilities for agencies, developers, and SaaS providers to extend the plugin without modifying core code.

* **Lazy-load static generation** — creates static pages only when visited, minimizing CPU and memory usage.
* **Automatic asset localization** — CSS, JS, images, and fonts are downloaded and referenced locally.
* **Relative path rewriting** — ensures portability for offline or CDN hosting.
* **Zero-configuration** — works instantly after activation.
* **Zero database impact** — does not create or modify any database tables.
* **Clean uninstall** — all options, transients, and cron events are removed automatically.
* **Background processing** — non-blocking, low-impact generation.
* **One-click export** — download a ZIP of the entire static site.
* **Modern UI** — intuitive, card-based dashboard.
* **WP-CLI Support** — manage generation, status, cleanup, and export directly from the terminal.
* **Clean HTML Output** - Removes 7+ WordPress meta tags for portable, framework-agnostic static files
* **Developer Hooks** - Two extensibility hooks for companion plugins and custom integrations
* **Enhanced Security** - WordPress version and internal metadata hidden from static exports
* **Optimized Performance** - 3.1% smaller files and 2.3% faster generation than previous versions

### WP-CLI Commands

Full control without the dashboard:

* `wp scw enable` – Enable static generation  
* `wp scw disable` – Disable static generation  
* `wp scw status` – View current status and statistics  
* `wp scw process` – Process all pending assets  
* `wp scw clear` – Remove all generated static files  
* `wp scw zip` – Create a ZIP archive of the site

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/static-cache-wrangler/` or install via Plugins > Add New.
2. Activate the plugin from the *Plugins* screen.
3. Navigate to **Settings → Static Cache** to enable generation.
4. Browse your site normally — pages are cached as they load.
5. Click **Download ZIP** to export the complete static version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it work with any theme or builder? =
Yes — Static Cache Wrangler captures the final rendered HTML, so it works with any theme, builder, or framework (Elementor®, Divi®, Gutenberg®, etc.).

= Does it use a lot of resources? =
No — it's designed as a *lazy loader*, generating static pages only on demand with minimal memory and CPU impact.

= Does it modify my database? =
No — it never alters your WordPress database schema or adds tables.  
All plugin-related options, transients, and scheduled events are automatically removed upon uninstall.

= Can I use the exported site on any server? =
Absolutely. The output is plain HTML and assets — deploy it on any web server, CDN, or open it directly in a browser.

= Does it handle dynamic content? =
Dynamic features like forms, comments, or live feeds won't function in the static version, but all rendered content and assets are preserved exactly.

= How do I update after making changes? =
Revisit the updated pages while generation is enabled, or run `wp scw process` to rebuild all static content.

= Can I customize the configuration? =

Yes! You can customize file locations and behavior using constants in `wp-config.php`:

**Change static files location:**
`define('STCW_STATIC_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/my-static-files/');`

**Change assets location:**
`define('STCW_ASSETS_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/my-assets/');`

**Disable async asset processing (process immediately):**
`define('STCW_ASYNC_ASSETS', false);`

= What if I need advanced customization? =

You can use WordPress filters to customize behavior:

**Exclude specific URLs from generation:**
`add_filter('stcw_should_generate', function($should, $url) {
    if (strpos($url, '/private/') !== false) {
        return false;
    }
    return $should;
}, 10, 2);`

**Modify HTML before saving:**
`add_filter('stcw_before_save_html', function($html) {
    return str_replace('</body>', '<footer>Generated: ' . date('Y-m-d') . '</footer></body>', $html);
});`

= What WordPress meta tags are removed in version 2.0.5? =

Version 2.0.5 removes the following WordPress-specific meta tags from static HTML:
* RSD (Really Simple Discovery) links for XML-RPC
* Windows Live Writer manifest links
* WordPress shortlink tags
* Generator meta tags (WordPress version)
* REST API discovery links
* oEmbed discovery links
* REST API HTTP headers
* `data-wp-strategy` attributes on script tags

These tags serve no purpose in static sites and removing them improves portability and security.

= How do I use the new developer hooks? =

**Remove additional WordPress tags:**
`
add_action('stcw_remove_wp_head_tags', function() {
    remove_action('wp_head', 'your_custom_action');
});
`

**Modify HTML before saving:**
`
add_filter('stcw_process_static_html', function($html) {
    // Add custom footer, remove tracking, etc.
    return $html;
});
`

See the plugin documentation for 15+ complete examples.

= Do I need to regenerate my static files after upgrading? =

No, but it's recommended. Existing static files will continue to work, but regenerating will give you the cleanest output with all WordPress meta tags removed:

`wp scw clear`
`wp scw enable`

Then browse your site to regenerate pages.

= Can I create companion plugins for Static Cache Wrangler? =

Yes! Version 2.0.5 introduces two hooks specifically designed for companion plugins:
* `stcw_remove_wp_head_tags` - Remove additional WordPress tags
* `stcw_process_static_html` - Modify final HTML output

These enable agencies, developers, and SaaS providers to build specialized extensions without modifying core plugin code.

= Will this work with my SEO plugin? =

Yes! Version 2.0.5 is fully compatible with:
* Yoast SEO
* Rank Math
* All in One SEO Pack
* SEOPress
* The SEO Framework

The meta tag removal only affects WordPress core tags, not SEO plugin meta tags that contain important information.

== Advanced Configuration ==

### Server Requirements

* **PHP:** 7.4 or higher
* **WordPress:** 5.0 or higher
* **PHP Extensions:** ZipArchive (for ZIP export), curl or allow_url_fopen (for asset downloads)
* **Disk Space:** Varies based on site size (static files = ~1.5x site size)
* **Permissions:** Write access to `wp-content/cache/`

### Performance Characteristics

* **Generation overhead:** ~50–100 ms/page
* **Memory:** ~2 MB additional per request
* **Asset downloads:** Handled asynchronously in background

### Disk Space Considerations

**Typical Usage:**
* Small site (10-50 pages): 50-200 MB
* Medium site (100-500 pages): 200 MB - 1 GB  
* Large site (1000+ pages): 1-5 GB

Monitor disk usage via Settings → Static Cache or `wp scw status`.

To reduce disk usage, exclude large pages:
`add_filter('stcw_should_generate', function($should, $url) {
    if (strpos($url, '/gallery/') !== false) {
        return false;
    }
    return $should;
}, 10, 2);`

### What Gets Downloaded

✅ CSS files, JavaScript files, Images (all formats), Fonts, Favicons, Responsive images (srcset)

❌ External CDN assets (preserved as-is), Third-party embeds (YouTube, Twitter), Video/audio files (intentionally excluded to save space)

**Static Cache Wrangler** (also historically referred to as **Static Cache Generator**) must always be referenced using all three words — **“Static Cache Wrangler.”**  

The prior name **Static Cache Generator** is considered a *legacy name* and is no longer in use, as it did not meet [WordPress.org plugin naming standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#1-plugins-must-have-unique-names) due to its generic nature. That name was originally selected in good faith to avoid any potential confusion with existing trademarks or brand names.  

Prior to renaming, **U.S. and international trademark databases** were reviewed by **independent intellectual property counsel**, and **no conflicts or registered marks** were identified for the phrases **“Static Cache Generator,” “Cache Generator,”** or **“Static Cache.”**

- *USPTO v. Booking.com B.V.*, 591 U.S. ___ (2020)  
- *In re Hotels.com, L.P.*, 573 F.3d 1300 (Fed. Cir. 2009)  
- *Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co.*, 305 U.S. 111 (1938)  

The current and accepted plugin name **Static Cache Wrangler**:  
- Does **not** imply, refer to, or associate with the standalone trademark **“Wrangler”** of **Wrangler Apparel**.  
- Does **not** imply, refer to, or associate with the standalone trademark **“Cache”** (U.S. Reg. No. **6094619**, registered July 7, 2020).  
- Does **not** imply, refer to, or associate with any trademarks involving the standalone term **“Static.”**  
- Has **no connection** with **Automattic Inc.**, its employees, or any internal job titles (e.g., “Wrangler”) used within Automattic. The name **Static Cache Wrangler** does not suggest endorsement, employment, or automation of work performed by Automattic personnel.  

This clarification is provided in accordance with **U.S. trademark law**, **WordPress.org plugin repository policies**, and general principles of fair use and naming transparency.
